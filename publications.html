<b>Abstract: </b> Image-based CSG rendering algorithms for standard
graphics hardware rely on multipass rendering that includes reading and 
writing large amounts of pixel data from and to the frame buffer. 
Since the performance of this data path has hardly improved over the 
last years, we describe new implementation techniques that efficiently 
use modern graphics hardware.
</p>

<p>
1) The render-to-texture ability is used to temporarily store shape
visibility, avoiding the expensive copy of z-buffer content to external memory.
Shape visibility is encoded discretely instead of using depth values. 
Hence, the technique is also not susceptible to artifacts in contrast to 
previously described methods.
</p>

<p>
2) We present an image-based technique for calculating the depth complexity 
of a CSG shape that avoids reading and analyzing pixel data from the 
frame buffer.
</p>

<p>
Both techniques optimize various CSG rendering algorithms, namely the
Goldfeather and the layered Goldfeather algorithm, and the
Sequenced-Convex-Subtraction (SCS) algorithm. This way, these 
image-based CSG algorithms now operate accelerated by graphics
hardware and, therefore, represent a significant improvement
towards real-time image-based CSG rendering for complex models.

<b>Abstract: </b> We present the design and implementation of a real-time 
3D graphics library for Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG).
This major approach of 3D modeling has not been supported 
by real-time computer graphics until recently.
</p>

<p>
We describe two essential image-based CSG rendering 
algorithms and an API that provides a compact access
to their complex functionality and implementation. 
As an important feature, the CSG library seamlessly
integrates application-defined 3D shapes as primitives
of CSG operations to ensure high adaptability and openness.
We also outline optimization techniques to improve the 
performance in the case of complex CSG models.
A number of use cases demonstrate potential applications of the library.

<p>
In my doctoral dissertation, I discuss how to integrate a variety of
different rendering algorithms, such as shadow mapping, reflection algorithms,
bump mapping, CSG rendering, etc., into a scene graph system. The goal
is to be able to use and combine several of those algorithms at the same time.
To simplify this task for the programmer using the scene graph, the
rendering effects are specified in the scene graph in a declarative way,
without notion of settings of the graphics hardware or of the required
rendering algorithms. Those are, consequently, derived internally 
by the library for evaluating the scene graph. 
</p>

<p>
In practice, this means that using this system I have combined all algorithms
provided by OpenCSG with different flavors of shadow mapping, stenciled
and textured reflections, environment mapping and bump mapping.
