<h3> <a href="news.html">Latest release: OpenCSG 1.8.1 (09-Mar-2025)</a></h3>

<hr>

<h3> <a name="introduction">Introduction</a> </h3>

<p>
OpenCSG is a library that does image-based CSG rendering using OpenGL.
It is written in C++ and supports most modern graphics hardware using
Microsoft Windows or the Linux operating system. 
The current version is <a href="https://www.opencsg.org/OpenCSG-1.8.1.tar.gz">OpenCSG-1.8.1</a>.
</p>

<p>
What is CSG, anyway? CSG is short for <b>Constructive Solid Geometry</b>
and denotes an approach to model complex 3D-shapes using simpler ones. I.e.,
two shapes can be combined by taking the union of them, by intersecting
them, or by subtracting one shape of the other. The
most basic shapes, which are not result of such a CSG operation,
are called <b>primitives</b>. Primitives must be <b>solid</b>, i.e.,
they must have a clearly defined interior and exterior. By construction,
a CSG shape is also solid then. 
</p>

<p>
Image-based CSG rendering (also z-buffer CSG rendering) is a term
for algorithms that render CSG shapes without an explicit calculation
of the geometric boundary of a CSG shape. Such algorithms use
frame-buffer settings of the graphics hardware, e.g., the depth and stencil
buffer, to compose CSG shapes. <b>OpenCSG</b> implements a variety of 
those algorithms, namely the <b>Goldfeather</b> algorithm and the <b>SCS</b> 
algorithm, both of them in several variants.

<h3> <a name="benefits">Benefits</a> </h3>

<p>
CSG is often used as fundamental modeling technique in CAD/CAM applications.
Here, image-based CSG rendering is the key to interactively manipulate CSG 
shapes. Since OpenCSG renders even complex CSG shapes fast, it can 
be advantageously used in such applications. 
</p>

<p>
Raytracers such as <a href="http://www.povray.org">PovRay</a> have 
used CSG for shape modeling since long ago. Interactive modeling
toolkits for such raytracers normally just ignore CSG commands, though. 
OpenCSG represents a valuable addition for such applications.
</p>

<p>
Before OpenCSG, CSG rendering has been hardly used in interactive 
applications, since the necessary algorithms are complicated and error-prone.
By providing a free library that is easy to use, fast, and portable,
OpenCSG has helped making CSG rendering more mainstream than it was
in the past.

<h3> <a name="prerequisites">Prerequisites</a> </h3>

<p>
The OpenCSG library requires OpenGL and graphics hardware that runs
OpenGL well. Note that OpenGL ES is currently not supported. The OpenGL
implementation must provide <b>frame buffer objects</b>.
</p>

<p>
Frame buffer objects are a more recent extension for OpenGL. They are
easy to develop for, and can be nowadays considered mature.
They are also part of OpenGL 3.0. Beginning with OpenCSG 1.2.0, they
are used by default.
</p>

<p>
In older versions, PBuffers were required to run OpenCSG. PBuffers
are probably deprecated nowadays, and since OpenCSG version 1.6.0,
they are no longer supported.
</p>

<p>
OpenCSG is written in C++ 98, uses namespaces and requires the STL.
It compiles with all reasonable C++ compilers such as gcc, Clang, or 
Microsoft Visual Studio. Workspaces for Visual Studio 2022, Visual C++ 6.
and <a href="http://www.bloodshed.net/devcpp.html">Dev-C++ 5.11</a> are
provided. Under Linux, any gcc compiler starting from version 3.0 will work.
</p>

<p>
OpenCSG has been sucessfully run on Intel and AMD CPUs. Generally,
NVidia and AMD graphics hardware is well supported, and hardware
where OpenCSG successfully has been run on includes everything
that has been produced in the last 15 years.
<p>
 
</p>
On graphics hardware from Intel, OpenCSG did not work so well in the past.
Recent OpenCSG versions contain fixes and workarounds for some bugs
reported for Intel hardware. It seems that most issues have been
fixed now. Still, generally, use the most recent graphics drivers,
in particular for older HD 3000 or HD 4000 hardware. Also, the
(non-default) Goldfeather rendering path generally appears to produce
more robust rendering results compared to the SCS rendering path.

<h3> <a name="usage">Usage</a> </h3>

<p>
<a name="primitive"></a>
The interface of OpenCSG is very easy to use. There
is only a single abstract class called <code><b>OpenCSG::Primitive</b></code>.
<a name="interfaceoperation"></a>
A <code>Primitive</code> object has an attribute <code><b>Operation</b></code>
that denotes whether the primitive is intersected or subtracted. 
To use OpenCSG, create a derived concrete primitive class by 
implementing the <code>render()</code> method. 
</p>

<p>
<a name="rendershape"></a>
To actually do the CSG rendering, there is the function <code><b>OpenCSG::render()</b></code> 
that takes a <code>std::vector&lt;Primitive*&gt;</code> as argument. 
The render function evaluates the CSG expression given by the array of primitives
and initializes the z-buffer with the proper values for the CSG expression.
The color buffer remains unchanged, so afterwards, you must shade
the primitives in the array using a <code>GL_EQUAL</code> depth function.
</p>

<p>
Note that the render function does not evaluate a generic CSG tree that
also would contain unions of CSG shapes. It has been shown that a
generic CSG tree can be converted into an equivalent set of CSG expressions
that the render function can handle. OpenCSG does not contain the 
functionality for this conversion since, after all, it is a rendering
library. 
</p>

<p>
Here is the complete interface of OpenCSG:
</p>
<p>
<code>

} <br>
</code>
</p>

<p>
<a name="interfaceconvexity"></a>
The <b>convexity</b> of a primitive is the maximum number of front (or back) 
faces of the primitive at a single position. For example, the convexity
of a sphere is one and the convexity of a torus is two. Actually 
the convexity attribute is currently only used in the standard Goldfeather
algorithm. For this algorithm, a convexity too low may result in
rendering errors, a convexity too high will reduce rendering 
performance. The other Goldfeather variants render primitives of any
convexity correctly without analyzing the convexity attribute. 
The SCS algorithms, on the other hand, can only handle primitives 
that have a convexity of one, else they produce rendering errors. 
Hence, SCS algorithms do not check this attribute. 
</p>

<p>
<a name="interfacebounds"></a>
The <b>bounding box</b> of the primitive can be provided using normal device
coordinates, i.e., after transforming the primitive with modelview and 
projection transformation. It is not necessary to set the bounding
box, but it allows for various performance optimizations.
</p>

<p>
<a name="interfacerenderprimitive"></a>
The abstract <b><code>render</code></b> method of the primitive is implemented in a
derived class. Your implementation must not alter the modelview or projection 
matrix (use <code>glPushMatrix</code> / <code>glPopMatrix</code> if in doubt).
Also you must not change the primary color in your implementation, since 
OpenCSG uses it internally (in all rendering algorithms). For best performance, 
you should only transmit vertex positions; no normals, texture coordinates, or 
whatever else.
</p>

<p>
The <b><code>render</code></b> function performs, as said above, z-shading of
a CSG expression. The content of the stencil buffer is destroyed when
handling concave primitives or when using the <code>DepthComplexitySampling</code> 
strategy.
</p>

<p>
<a name="vertexshader"></a>
Optionally, with <b><code>setVertexShader</code></b> the code of a GLSL <b>vertex shader</b>
can be provided to OpenCSG, that is used by OpenCSG for transforming the
geometry. By default, or when an empty vertex shader is set, OpenCSG
uses the fixed function pipeline. When setting a non-empty vertex
shader, that shader is used. There is no need, and no possibility,
to set a corresponding fragment shader. OpenCSG internally sets
a matching fragment shader itself.
</p>

<p>
The intent is that the shader can transform the vertices in
exactly the same way as later, when the geometry is shaded
by the caller using the GL_EQUAL depth function. This approach
is needed to avoid z-artifacts when using GLSL.
</p>

<p>
<a name="options"></a>
Using the functions <b><code>setOption() / getOption()</code></b> you can control
and ask for certain settings used when rendering a CSG expression. You can
specify the 
<a href="#algorithm"> Algorithm</a>, the method of 
<a href="#depthalgorithm">depth
complexity usage</a> and the <a href="#offscreentype">type of offscreen
buffer</a>.
</p>

<p>
<a name="algorithm"></a>
The <b><code>Algorithm</code></b> parameter specifies the method used for CSG rendering.
Besides <code>Goldfeather</code> and <code>SCS</code>, you can also choose
<b><code>Automatic</code></b>: This setting chooses the Goldfeather algorithm if 
the primitive array contains concave primitives, else it chooses SCS. 
The automatic setting also sets the <code>DepthComplexityAlgorithm</code> 
(<code>NoDepthComplexitySampling</code> for arrays with few primitives, 
else <code>OcclusionQuery</code> or at the last resort <code>DepthComplexitySampling</code>).
</p>

<p>
Aforesaid means that it is not possible to do CSG
rendering of concave primitives and preserving the stencil buffer.
</p>

<p>
<a name="depthalgorithm"></a>
If the <code>Automatic</code> setting is not used,
the <b><code>DepthComplexityAlgorithm</code></b> parameter specifies the strategy 
for profiting from <b>depth complexity</b>.
</p>
<ul>
<li><code>NoDepthComplexitySampling</code>: Does not employ the depth complexity.
  This essentially makes the algorithm O(n²), but with low constant costs.</li>
<li><code>DepthComplexitySampling</code>: Calculates the depth complexity k using
  the stencil buffer. This makes the algorithm O(n*k), but with high constant costs. 
  In case of the Goldfeather algorithm, the literature denotes this as 
  layered Goldfeather algorithm.</li>
<li><code>OcclusionQuery</code>: Uses occlusion queries to profit implicitly from
  depth complexity without calculating it. This is especially useful for 
  the SCS algorithm where this strategy is applied at shape level, resulting in a 
  O(n*k') algorithm (where k' <= k), without significant constant overhead. 
  This strategy requires hardware occlusion queries, i.E., the OpenGL extensions
  <code>GL_ARB_occlusion_query</code>, eventually <code>GL_ARB_occlusion_query2</code>,
  or <code>GL_NV_occlusion_query</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<a name="offscreentype"></a>
The offscreen type specifies what kind of offscreen buffer OpenCSG uses for
internal CSG calculations. This setting is kind of obsolete with the removal
of the <code>PBuffer</code> option, that was removed in version 1.6.0.
The default <code>AutomaticOffscreenType</code>, and also the setting
<code>FrameBufferObject</code> preferably use, if the required OpenGL extensions
are available, <code>FrameBufferObjectARB</code>, then <code>FrameBufferObjectEXT</code>.
The remaining settings <code>FrameBufferObjectARB</code>, and <code>FrameBufferObjectEXT</code>
directly map to the usage of the corresponding OpenGL extension.
</p>

<p>
<a name="depthboundsoptimization"></a>
The depth bounds optimization improves the rendering performance by using
the OpenGL extension <code>GL_EXT_depth_bounds_test</code> to restrict
rendering to only the depth range indicated by the bounding box of a 
primitive. This optimization is, by default, turned off. If you enable
it, ensure that the z-ranges of the bounding boxes are large enough,
otherwise they will not be correctly rendered. The gains you will get
from this optimization is probably only small. 
</p>

<p>
<a name="cameraoutsideoptimization"></a>
The <code>CameraOutsideOptimization</code> setting enables rendering
optimizations that are only valid if the camera is known to be
outside of the CSG model. I.e., if the camera is inside of the
CSG model and the setting is enabled, rendering errors occur
that could be avoided otherwise. By default, this setting is
enabled(!) for the SCS, but disabled for the Goldfeather algorithm.
See the following remarks on the two algorithms for details:
<p>

</p>
For the Goldfeather algorithm, the setting controls
the way that the parity value for a surface is calculated, which is
the number of surfaces in front of the candidate surface in question. The textbook
approach to determine it is to render all surfaces that are in front
(z-pass). This has the drawback, though, that if the camera is inside
of the CSG model, some surfaces could be clipped by the view frustum,
resulting that rendering is incorrect. The alternative approach is to
render surfaces behind (z-fail). With that, incorrect clipping of the
surfaces is much less likely to happen and easy to avoid. So this is
the more robust setting. Since 1.7.0, z-fail is implemented in OpenCSG
and done by default. The performance of the two settings is usually
similar. If your camera is outside of the CSG model, you may enable the
optimization to check if it works better for you. The setting
is also a chicken bit in case the new z-fail setting shows unexpected
problems.  
</p>

<p>
In the SCS algorithm, the setting controls the workings in the
subtraction phase of the algorithm. When subtracting a primitive
relative to the current z-buffer, the textbook approach
is to mark the visible, front-facing polygons of the primitive in
the stencil buffer. (At these places then the z-buffer is updated
with the back-facing polygons behind the z-buffer). This approach
however fails if the front faces of the subtracted primitive are
clipped. The alternative, more compatible approach renders the
primitive even one more time to avoid this problem. Due to the
additional rendering pass, this approach is a bit slower. Since
1.7.0, OpenCSG implements this more robust approach. But
it does not use it by default, mainly because not all kinds of
rendering errors, related to the camera being inside the CSG model,
are addressed by it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="context"></a>
OpenCSG creates, and reuses between different <code>render()</code> calls,
various OpenGL resources such as frame buffer objects. This
may be a problem in MDI applications with several OpenGL windows, of which
the OpenGL contexts are not shared. In this case, OpenGL resources allocated
in one OpenGL context cannot be reused with another context, so OpenCSG
would produce rendering errors. To solve this, the OpenCSG context
can be set to some unique integer identifier of the OpenGL window.
OpenCSG then creates/uses OpenGL resources in the <code>render()</code>
function per context. The function <code>freeResources()</code> frees
OpenGL resources for the currently active OpenCSG context.

I have developed the algorithms for OpenCSG in my time as research assistent
at HPI at the University Potsdam. In this time the following publications 
about OpenCSG and about image-based CSG rendering have been written:

</b> Journal of WSCG, 12(2):221-228, 2004. </p>
<p> This paper gives an introduction to image-based CSG rendering and describes
    the two techniques that are used in OpenCSG to accelerate rendering compared
    to older implementations: Visibility transfer using textures and occlusion
    queries for the SCS algorithm. </p>

<h3> <a name="FAQ">FAQ</a> </h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><b>Can I render a shape with
    different colors? The documentation says I must not change the primary
    color in the function of my class for primitives, since
    OpenCSG uses the color for internal purposes.</b> </p>
    <p> You can shade your shapes with whatever color you want.
      While your primitive objects for use in OpenCSG must not use
    the primary color, after calculating z-values with OpenCSG you are free
    to render the same geometry with primary colors. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><b>Does OpenCSG require a stencil buffer?</b> </p>
    <p>You must setup a stencil buffer in your application when rendering
        concave primitives or when using <code>DepthComplexitySampling</code>.
        Internally, the stencil buffer is always needed in OpenCSG
        when rendering into the offscreen frame buffer object.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><b>Can OpenCSG calculate the geometry of a CSG expression?</b> </p>
    <p> No, unfortunately this is not possible using image-based CSG algorithms
        (at least not in a trivial way). If you require this, have a look
        at other libraries such as the
        <a href="http://gts.sourceforge.net">GTS library</a>. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><b>My camera is inside of the CSG model, and rendering is not correct. What can I do?</b> </p>
    <p>Since version 1.7.0, if the camera is inside of subtracted primitives, the Goldfeather
       algorithm in OpenCSG should handle these cases correctly. You must ensure that the back sides of the subtracted
       primitives are not clipped by the view frustum. For more information, read the documentation
       on the <code>CameraOutsideOptimization</code> setting.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><b>What are the dependencies of the example program?</b> </p>
    <p> The OpenCSG example requires <a href="http://www.opengl.org/resources/libraries/glut.html">GLUT</a> or <a href="http://freeglut.sourceforge.net">
        FreeGLUT</a>. One of these libraries is likely pre-installed with your
        favorite linux installation. Visual Studio users should compile or
	download FreeGLUT, or with older versions of Visual Studio they may install
        <a href="http://www.xmission.com/~nate/glut.html">GLUT for Windows</a>.
        Dev-C++ users can install the <a href="https://www.transmissionzero.co.uk/software/freeglut-devel">precompiled GLUT for Mingw32</a>. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><b>Is there any relationship between this OpenCSG and the AI company OpenCSG?</b> </p>
    <p>No. The CSG rendering library OpenCSG is an independent project and has no affiliation with the Beijing-based AI company of the same name. </p>
