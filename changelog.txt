26.11.2004
    Changed: queries for the p-buffer facilities in RenderTexture

28.09.2004
    Fixed: refactored heuristic for depth complexity sampling
        thereby fixing an odd performance bug

27.09.2004
    Release 1.0.1

25.09.2004
    Fixed: stupid bug in respect scissoring change

24.09.2004
    Added: respect scissoring setting of OpenGL; calculate CSG
        z-values only in the given scissor area.

23.09.2004
    Added: StencilManager, that, in future will possibly save and 
        restore the stencil buffer of the main frame buffer. The
        StencilManager is currently deactivated, though.

06.08.2004
    Fixed: RenderTexture did not report the correct stencil size
        of the pbuffer under linux. The expected values are now
        written there by hand.

20.07.2004
    Changed: Updated RenderTexture to version 2.0.3. This requires 
        further testing on all possible platforms because I have 
        removed some private hacks due to this change.

02.05.2004
    Release 1.0.0

22.04.2004:
    Changed: Makefiles on Linux are now derived from qmake. However,
        the provided Makefiles should work directly without using
        qmake, it is best to stick with them.

22.04.2004: 
    Changed: Compile a shared library on Linux now

08.04.2004:
    Changed: When possible use GL_TEXTURE_RECTANGLE_NV texture format
        even if GL_TEXTURE_2D would work also. The former appears to be
        faster. 

29.03.2004
    Changed: Scissoring area was chosen too big, because I had 
        confused width/height with right/top margin. This is fixed
        now, resulting in better performance for some models

25.03.2004
    Added: Area structs for pixel and normalized device coordinates. 
        Used to speed up depth complexity sampling by restricting 
        readback to smaller Area
    Added: Check whether primitive vector is empty

24.03.2004
    Changed: Hided occlusion query implementations in cpp
        Renamed OcclusionQueryAdapter to OcclusionQuery

02.03.2004
    Release 0.9.2

17.02.2004
    Added: Support for ARB_occlusion_query extension

21.11.2003:
    Release 0.9.1

21.11.2003:
    Fixed: std::max() std::min() issue with .net

18.11.2003:
    Fixed: Bug with heuristic for resizing the pbuffer-resizing
        that occured for request for sizes of the form 512x1024
        -> 1024x512 -> 512x1024 -> ... (and similar series)

06.11.2003: 
    Added: Detection of GL_FRONT_FACE OpenGL setting. This means that
        CSG rendering is now also correct if this setting is the
        non-default clockwise setting.

04.11.2003: 
    Fixed: Stenciling was not disabled in SCS algorithm when 
        subtracting no shapes. This could lead to obscure rendering 
        errors when rendering the next CSG shape. 

02.11.2003: 
    Added: Heuristic that makes the pbuffer smaller 
        if the size of the pbuffer has been bigger than necessary in 
        x- or y- direction for a certain number of render-calles. 
        This permits to use OpenCSG for CSG rendering in different
        canvases with different sizes without constant expensive
        resizing of the pbuffer for every frame.

01.10.2003 
    Fixed: linux: removed accidental linking against tcl/tk  

23.09.2003: 
    Release 0.9
